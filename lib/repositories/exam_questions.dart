    question: '1. Describe the process of a volcanic eruption from the rise of magma to the eruption itself.',
    answer: "The process begins deep within the Earth's mantle, where heat and pressure cause rocks to melt, forming magma. This magma is less dense than the surrounding rock, causing it to rise towards the surface. As it ascends, the pressure decreases, allowing gas bubbles to form within the magma. When the magma reaches the surface, the release of gas bubbles increases its velocity, leading to an eruption. This eruption can expel lava, ash, and gases into the atmosphere.",

    question: '2. Compare and contrast the three main types of volcanoes.',
    answer: "Shield volcanoes have broad, gently sloping sides and erupt basaltic lava that flows easily. Composite or stratovolcanoes are characterized by steep, conical shapes and erupt explosively, expelling ash, lava, and rocks. Cinder cone volcanoes are the smallest type, built from blobs of lava ejected from a single vent, forming steep conical hills. While shield volcanoes tend to have non-explosive eruptions, composite and cinder cone volcanoes are known for their explosive activity.",

    question: '3. Explain the role of volcanoes in climate change and provide examples.',
    answer: "Volcanoes can have a significant impact on climate change, primarily through the emission of sulfur dioxide gas, which can lead to global cooling. For example, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 released millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, forming a sulfuric acid mist that reflected sunlight away from the Earth, causing a global temperature drop of about 0.5 degrees Celsius for a year.",

    question: '4. Discuss the significance of volcanology in disaster preparedness and risk management.',
    answer: "Volcanology plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness and risk management by studying volcanic activity and predicting eruptions. This knowledge allows for the development of evacuation plans, the creation of exclusion zones around dangerous volcanoes, and the implementation of early warning systems, significantly reducing the risk to human life and property.",

    question: '5. Describe a famous volcanic eruption and its impact on human society or the environment.',
    answer: "The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD is one of the most famous volcanic eruptions, which buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum under ash and pumice. The sudden catastrophe preserved the cities in remarkable detail, providing invaluable archaeological and historical insight into Roman life but at the cost of thousands of lives.",

  Completion(
    question: '6. Use at least five vocabulary words learned in this course in sentences.',
    answer: """"The magma chamber beneath the volcano swelled, indicating an imminent eruption." - "Seismographs detected increased seismic activity around the volcano's base." - "Pyroclastic flows can race down the slopes of a volcano at speeds exceeding 100 km/h." - "Volcanic ash clouds can drift thousands of kilometers, affecting air travel and climate." - "The local government issued an evacuation order based on the volcanologist's risk assessment.\"""",

  Completion(
    question: '7. Construct a detailed explanation of how volcanoes are predicted and the challenges involved.',
    answer: "Volcanoes are predicted through monitoring seismic activity, gas emissions, ground deformation, and thermal and satellite imagery. Increased seismic activity can indicate magma movement towards the surface. Changes in gas composition can signal that an eruption is near. Ground deformation, such as swelling of the volcanoâ€™s slopes, suggests magma accumulation. However, predicting the exact timing and size of an eruption remains challenging due to the complex nature of volcanic systems and the variability in the signs leading up to an eruption.",
